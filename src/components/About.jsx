      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p> Hi! I’m Muhammad Rayyan, a passionate software developer and problem solver. I love creating interactive and visually appealing web applications, exploring new technologies, and building projects that make a real impact. From designing sleek user interfaces to writing clean, efficient code, I enjoy turning ideas into functional digital experiences.

When I’m not coding, you can find me playing cricket, learning about AI and cybersecurity, or exploring innovative tech solutions. I aim to combine creativity and logic to build applications that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use.</p>
